This project is coded by chat got 3o-mini
The main objective to make this project is privacy
We believe that everyone should have its own private space
and everyone has write to chat freely 
Whithout sending any information to any server
Ofcourse big chatting apps stole your data
and sell it,Local chat solve this problem 
It only store chats and file on user phone who is
hosting site and that data is end-to-end encrypted 
A normal person cannot read it also for privacy reasons 
We add login and register option so anyone on your network will not access
your private chat or data
You are free to modify this without any issue
You can change UI or use my UI and code anywhere you want
But please not forget to give star on github
Thanks for reading!!
